# Quick Evaluation System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a new quick evaluation flow that automatically evaluates user answers immediately after form submission. Auto-scoreable questions are displayed with their scores grouped by category, while upload-dependent questions are marked for manual review.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: `QuickEvaluationReport` (`components/quick-evaluation-report.tsx`)
- Displays answers organized by category with automatic scoring
- Shows total score and percentage
- Highlights that uploaded documents require manual review
- Only displays questions that are auto-scoreable (no uploads required)

**Key Features:**
- Group answers by category
- Show points earned vs max points for each answer
- Display overall score and percentage
- Show per-category breakdown
- Warning about manual review of uploads

### 2. Updated: `ApplicationSubmission` (`components/application-submission.tsx`)
**New Logic:**
- Added `isAutoScorable()` function to determine which questions can be auto-evaluated
  - `media_only` questions are NOT auto-scoreable
  - `multiple_choice` questions with points ARE auto-scoreable
  - Only auto-scoreable questions contribute to the quick evaluation score
  
- Modified `handleSubmit()` to:
  1. Separate auto-scoreable from non-scoreable questions
  2. Calculate scores only for auto-scoreable questions
  3. Prepare evaluation data grouped by category
  4. Save ALL answers to database (both auto-scoreable and non-scoreable)
  5. Track points_earned for each answer (0 for non-scoreable questions)
  6. Display `QuickEvaluationReport` instead of generic success message

- Added state: `evaluationData` to track scores and answers for display

### 3. Updated: `SubmissionDetailView` (`components/submission-detail-view.tsx`)
**Improvements:**
- Grouped uploaded files by their corresponding question
- Files now appear under their question instead of in a separate section
- Shows file size and download link for each uploaded file
- Hides points display for media-only questions
- Added section for unlinked documents (if any)

**Layout Changes:**
```
Question 1
  - Answer text
  - Uploaded Files: [File1, File2]
Question 2
  - Answer text
  - (No files)
```

## Data Flow

### Submission Process
1. User answers all questions
2. User submits form
3. System separates questions into:
   - **Auto-scoreable**: Multiple choice questions with points, no uploads required
   - **Manually reviewable**: Text questions, media-only questions, questions with uploads
4. Calculate scores for auto-scoreable questions only
5. Save all answers with calculated points
6. Display quick evaluation report
7. Show breakdown by category

### Question Types & Scoring

| Type | Auto-Scoreable | Scoring |
|------|---|---|
| Multiple Choice (no upload) | ✅ Yes | Points from selected option |
| Multiple Choice (with upload) | ❌ No | Manual review only |
| Text | ❌ No | Manual review only |
| Media Only | ❌ No | Manual review only |

## User Experience

1. **After Submission:**
   - User sees immediate feedback with auto-scored results
   - Results grouped by category
   - Clear indication of percentage score
   - Warning that uploads require manual review

2. **Viewing Submission Details:**
   - Answers are shown with their points (if auto-scored)
   - Upload questions don't show points
   - Uploaded files appear directly under their question
   - Can download files from the question section

## Database Changes
No database schema changes needed. The existing `submission_answers` table stores:
- `points_earned`: 0 for non-scoreable questions, calculated points for auto-scoreable
- `answer_value` and `answer_text` for all question types

## Benefits
1. ✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Users see evaluation results instantly
2. ✅ **Clear Expectations**: Separate auto-scored vs manually reviewed sections
3. ✅ **Better Organization**: Files linked to their questions
4. ✅ **Accurate Scoring**: Only auto-scoreable questions count toward automatic score
5. ✅ **Flexible Review**: Manual reviewer can adjust scores as needed
