# Scoring System Update - Points Hidden, Percentage-Based Reporting

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Points from Question Forms** (`application-submission.tsx`)
- **Before**: Questions showed `10 points` badge during form completion
- **After**: No points badge displayed while answering questions
- Users now focus on answering without seeing point values

### 2. **Quick Evaluation Report - Percentage-Based** (`quick-evaluation-report.tsx`)
- **Overall Score Section**:
  - Changed from: `25/30 points`
  - Changed to: `83%` + Performance level (Excellent/Good/Fair/Needs Work)
  
- **Category Breakdown**:
  - Changed from: `Category Name: 25/30 (83%)`
  - Changed to: `Category Name` with `83%` badge
  
- **Individual Question Display**:
  - Changed from: `Q1 [10/10 pts]`
  - Changed to: `Q1 [100%]` (percentage of max possible for that question)

### 3. **Submission Detail View** (`submission-detail-view.tsx`)
- Removed individual point badges from answers
- Questions no longer show `X/Y pts` format
- Cleaner presentation focusing on the answer content

### 4. **User Dashboard Submissions** (`user-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Score Section**: Now shows percentage instead of fraction
  - Changed from: `Score: 25/30`
  - Changed to: `Your Score: 83%`
  
- **Status Section**: Added Status column for clarity
  - Shows: "Evaluating...", "Approved", "Rejected", etc.

## Scoring Logic Unchanged
The **scoring calculation remains the same** internally:
- Points are still calculated based on option points
- Auto-scoreable questions still use max question points
- Database stores everything correctly

The change is **presentation-only** - points are hidden from users but still used for calculations.

## User Experience Impact

### Before
- Users saw individual point values while answering
- Reports showed: `25/30 (83%)`
- Points visible everywhere

### After
- Clean form with no point distractions ✓
- Reports show only: `83%` and performance level ✓
- Performance-based feedback instead of numerical scores ✓
- Cleaner, modern interface ✓
