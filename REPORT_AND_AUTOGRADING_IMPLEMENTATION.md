# Professional Report & Auto-Grading Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a professional PDF report system for approved submissions and automatic point granting for media upload questions when approved by reviewers.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Submission Complete Card** ✅
**File**: `components/quick-evaluation-report.tsx`

- Removed the green "Submission Complete!" card with CheckCircle2 icon
- Now shows only the evaluation summary immediately
- Cleaner user experience after form submission
- Removed unused import: `CheckCircle2`

### 2. **Professional PDF Report Generator** ✅
**File**: `lib/pdf-generator.ts` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Creates professional, print-ready HTML reports
- Beautiful layout with:
  - Header with application title
  - Applicant info (name, status, dates)
  - Overall score and performance level
  - Category breakdown with percentages
  - Individual question answers with scores
  - Reviewer notes (if available)
  - Professional styling and formatting

**Functions:**
- `generatePDFHTML()` - Generates HTML content for the report
- `downloadPDFReport()` - Opens print dialog for PDF download using browser's native print-to-PDF

**Usage:**
```typescript
const reportData = {
  applicationTitle: "Tax Evaluation",
  applicantName: "John Doe",
  submittedDate: "Oct 28, 2025",
  status: "approved",
  percentage: 85,
  categoryScores: [...],
  reviewNotes: "Well done!"
}
downloadPDFReport(reportData)
```

### 3. **PDF Download Button** ✅
**File**: `components/submission-detail-view.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added import for PDF generator utilities
- Added `handleDownloadReport()` function that:
  - Groups answers by category
  - Calculates percentages for each answer
  - Prepares report data structure
  - Triggers PDF download

- Added "Download Report" button in header when `status === "approved"`
- Button shows Download icon + text
- Only visible for approved submissions

### 4. **Automatic Point Granting for Media Uploads** ✅
**File**: `components/submission-review.tsx`

**When Reviewer Approves:**
1. System checks for media-only or media upload questions
2. **Grants full max points** to those questions
3. Recalculates total score including media uploads
4. Updates submission with new scores

**Logic:**
```
Media-only questions → Grant full points if approved
Media upload questions → Grant full points if approved
Auto-scored questions → Keep original points
```

**Process Flow:**
1. Admin selects "Approved" status
2. Admin clicks "Save Review"
3. System:
   - Identifies all media-related questions
   - Updates their `points_earned` to max
   - Recalculates `total_score`
   - Updates `max_score`
   - Marks submission as approved with reviewer info

### 5. **Updated Score Calculation**

**Before Approval:**
- Only auto-scored questions counted
- Media uploads = 0 points

**After Approval:**
```
Total Score = Auto-scored questions + Media upload full points
Max Score = All question points (auto + media)
```

## Report Layout

### Header Section
- Application title
- Applicant name
- Status badge (Approved/Rejected/Under Review)
- Submission date
- Review date (if reviewed)

### Score Section
```
Overall Score: 85%
