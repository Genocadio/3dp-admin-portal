# 🔧 Email Not Showing - Debugging Guide

## ✅ Problem Solved!

The issue has been fixed. Here's what was happening and what changed:

---

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

**Original Issue:**
- Emails were only being logged to the **Node.js server console**
- Users never saw the verification codes
- The frontend had no visibility into what was happening

**Root Cause:**
- In development mode, the system logged emails to the server terminal
- Users were looking in the browser console (which was empty)
- The frontend didn't show test codes

---

## ✨ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Email Logging** ✅
The server now logs much more detailed information:

```
============================================================
📧 EMAIL NOTIFICATION
============================================================
To: user@example.com
Subject: Reset Your Password - 3DP Admin Portal
------------------------------------------------------------
TEXT VERSION:
[email text shown]
------------------------------------------------------------
HTML VERSION:
[email html shown]
============================================================
```

### 2. **Test Code Display in Browser** ✅
- When you request a password reset, the **test code now appears on the page**
- Shows in a blue box with the 6-digit code
- Also logs to browser console for easy copying

### 3. **Better Error Handling** ✅
- If email service fails, system gracefully continues
- Reset codes still work even if email doesn't send
- Clear warnings shown in server logs

---

## 🚀 How to Get the Code Now

### Method 1: **On the Forgot Password Page** (EASIEST)
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password
2. Enter your email
3. ✅ See the blue box with test code
4. Copy the code and use it
```

### Method 2: **Check Server Terminal** 
```
1. Look at your terminal where you ran `npm run dev`
2. Find the "📧 EMAIL NOTIFICATION" section
3. Copy the 6-digit code
```

### Method 3: **Browser Console** (F12)
```
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for: "🧪 DEV MODE: Test code: XXXXXX"
4. Copy the code
```

## 📝 Testing Steps

### Complete Test Flow

**Step 1: Start the app**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Step 2: Go to forgot password**
```

```

**Step 3: Enter email and watch for code**
```
Email: test@example.com
[Submit]

✅ See blue box with code like: 123456
```

**Step 4: Copy code and enter it**
```
Go to "code" step
Enter: 123456 (the code you saw)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Keep Terminal Visible
Run the dev server in one terminal, keep it visible to see emails being "sent"

### Tip 2: Copy from Page
The blue code box on the page is easiest - just click and copy

### Tip 3: Check Console First
If you don't see the blue box, open browser console (F12) and look for the code

### Tip 4: Server Logs Have Full Content
The server terminal shows the full email that would be sent - useful for testing email templates

---

## 🎯 For Production (Email Service)

When ready to use real email (Resend, SendGrid, etc.):

1. Install: `npm install resend`
2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
   ```
3. Restart: `npm run dev`
4. Now emails will actually send
5. Test code still shows in dev mode for testing

## 🐛 Still Not Working?

### Issue: Blue code box not appearing
**Solution:** 
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache
- Restart `npm run dev`

### Issue: Code not working when entered
**Solution:**
- Code expires after 15 minutes - request new one
- Code might not match - copy again carefully
- Whitespace issues - use copy button instead of typing

### Issue: Server logs not showing
**Solution:**
- Check terminal where you ran `npm run dev`
- Look for "📧 EMAIL NOTIFICATION" header
- If not there, check if process crashed and rerun

### Issue: Still nothing
**Solution:**
- Run `npm run dev` in fresh terminal
- Check for error messages in terminal
- Try different email address
- Check browser console (F12) for JS errors
